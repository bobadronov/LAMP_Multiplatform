## Overview

LAMP_Arduino is a project for creating a smart LED lamp controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. It
supports various effects, integrates with a real-time clock module (DS3231), and optionally supports
a temperature and humidity sensor (DHT11).

## Features

- Wi-Fi configuration through a captive portal
- Wireless controll via WiFi on Android, iOS, Windows
- Multiple LED effects (static colors, rainbow, fire, etc.)
- Real-time clock integration (DS3231) for time-based operations
- Optional temperature and humidity monitoring (DHT11)
- Button support for additional input options
- NTP synchronization for accurate timekeeping

## Requirements

### Hardware

- **ESP32**
- **WS2812B LED strip**
- **DS3231** (optional)
- **DHT11** (optional)
